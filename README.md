# Single-Channel-Queue-Simulation-Implementation-Using-Cplusplus
This is an implementation of Single Channel Queue Simulation Using C++ Language.

<br>

This can be used for different purposes where we can see a single channel queue property. For example: A simulation of a grocery store. 

Assumptions
* Only one checkout counter. 
* Customers arrive at this checkout counter at random from 1 to 8 minutes apart. Each possible value of interarrival time has the same probability of occurrence
* The service times vary from 1 to 6 minutes with the probabilities
* The problem is to analyze the system by simulating the arrival and service of 20 customers.

## This code can be used for random input vairable as well as direct input variables, see the input/output structure below for more clarification.

## I used file to take input and also for output. So put your input in in.txt file to see the output.
